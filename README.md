# Discord Package Parser

Simple tool that allows you to parse all the channels ids and all your messages sent in them from your personal package data on discord.

## How to use
Place the executable at the root of your discord package data and run it.

It will generate a file called `messages.txt` with all the channels ids mapped to the messages you sent in them.

## What can I do with this ?
You can force discord to delete all the channels in your package data by sending a request to the discord support.

This tool should support both legacy and current discord package data.
If not you can always open an issue.
